title: Metis Project 1

The Metis bootcamp is a project-oriented program. What this means is that throughout the course of program each student is expected to complete five total projects and present their results.

The projects move quickly.

My program started this past Wednesday (July 5th), and we presented our first projects today. While this was not a lot of time to fully explore the questions asked of us, the pace of the work definitely encouraged focus and quick learning, not least so that we didn't look like fools when presenting 4-5 days worth of research.

Below is a overview of Project 1 as well as my process as I worked through the problem:
