title: Metis Project 1
---

The Metis bootcamp is a project-oriented program. What this means is that throughout the course of program each student is expected to complete five total projects and present their results.

The projects move quickly.

My program started this past Wednesday (July 5th), and we presented our first projects today. While this was not a lot of time to fully explore the questions asked of us, the pace of the work definitely encouraged focus and quick learning, not least so that we didn't look like fools when presenting 4-5 days worth of research.

Below is a overview of Project 1 as well as my process as I worked through the problem:

### Problem Introduction
My project partner and I were tasked with helping a fictional non-profit, WomenTechWomenYes, explore ways to increase visibility in the greater New York City area in the hopes of increasing donations as well as attendance at an upcoming gala.

We were tasked with using [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html) to analyze the best subway stations where WomenTechWomenYes should place their volunteers. While we were encouraged to use other data sources if desired, the main idea of the project involved using the data science tools learned in the Metis bootcamp to clean and analyze this MTA turnstile data.

### Data Analysis
Most of the data analysis was done in a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), and involved basic analysis using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandas_(software)">pandas</a> and [matplotlib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matplotlib) libraries (two core libraries that every data scientist needs to know).
